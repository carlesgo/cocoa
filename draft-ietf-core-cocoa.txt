                CoAP Simple Congestion Control/Advanced
                      draft-ietf-core-cocoa-latest

Abstract

   The CoAP protocol needs to be implemented in such a way that it does
   not cause persistent congestion on the network it uses.  The CoRE
   CoAP specification defines basic behavior that exhibits low risk of
   congestion with minimal implementation requirements.  It also leaves
   room for combining the base specification with advanced congestion
   control mechanisms with higher performance.

   This specification defines some simple advanced CoRE Congestion
   Control mechanisms, Simple CoCoA.  It is making use of input from
   simulations and experiments in real networks.

1.  Introduction

   The CoAP protocol needs to be implemented in such a way that it does
   not cause persistent congestion on the network it uses.  The CoRE
   CoAP specification defines basic behavior that exhibits low risk of
   congestion with minimal implementation requirements.  It also leaves
   room for combining the base specification with advanced congestion
   control mechanisms with higher performance.

   The present specification defines such an advanced CoRE Congestion
   Control mechanism, with the goal of improving performance while
   retaining safety as well as the simplicity that is appropriate for

   constrained devices.  Hence, we are calling this mechanism Simple
   CoCoA (Congestion Control/Advanced).

   In the Internet, congestion control is typically implemented in a way
   that it can be introduced or upgraded unilaterally.  Still, a new
   congestion control scheme must not be introduced lightly.  To ensure
   that the new scheme is not posing a danger to the network,
   considerable work has been done on simulations and experiments in
   real networks.  Some of this work will be mentioned in "Discussion"
   subsections in the following sections; an overview is given in
   Appendix A.  Extended rationale for this specification can also be
   found in the historical Internet-Drafts
   [I-D.bormann-core-congestion-control] and
   [I-D.eggert-core-congestion-control], as well as in the minutes of
   the IETF 84 CoRE WG meetings.

1.1.  Terminology

   This specification uses terms from [RFC7252].  In addition, it
   defines the following terminology:

   Initiator:  The endpoint that sends the message that initiates an
      exchange.  E.g., the party that sends a confirmable message, or a
      non-confirmable message conveying a request.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   (Note that the present document is itself informational, but it is
   discussing normative statements about behavior that makes the
   congestion control scheme work in a safe manner.)

   The term "byte", abbreviated by "B", is used in its now customary
   sense as a synonym for "octet".

2.  Context

   In the definition of the CoAP protocol [RFC7252], an approach was
   taken that includes a very simple basic scheme (lock-step with the
   number of parallel exchanges usually limited to 1) in the base
   specification together with performance-enhancing advanced
   mechanisms.

   The present specification is based on the approved text in the
   [RFC7252] base specification.  It is making use of the text that



Bormann, et al.          Expires April 29, 2018                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              CoAP Simple CoCoA               October 2017


   permits advanced congestion control mechanisms and allows them to
   change protocol parameters, including NSTART and the binary
   exponential backoff mechanism.  Note that Section 4.8 of [RFC7252]
   limits the leeway that implementations have in changing the CoRE
   protocol parameters.

   The present specification also assumes that, outside of exchanges,
   non-confirmable messages can only be used at a limited rate without
   an advanced congestion control mechanism (this is mainly relevant for
   [RFC7641]).  It is also intended to address the [RFC8085] guideline
   about combining congestion control state for a destination; and to
   clarify its meaning for CoAP using the definition of an endpoint.

   The present specification does not address multicast or dithering
   beyond basic retransmission dithering.

3.  Area of Applicability

   The present algorithm is intended to be generally applicable.  The
   objective is to be "better" than default CoAP congestion control in a
   number of characteristics, including achievable goodput for a given
   offered load, latency, and recovery from bursts, while providing more
   predictable stress to the network and the same level of safety from
   catastrophic congestion.  It does require three state variables per
   scope plus the state needed to do RTT measurements, so it may not be
   applicable to the most constrained devices (class 1 as per
   [RFC7228]).

   The scope of each instance of the algorithm in the current set of
   evaluations has been the five-tuple, i.e., CoAP + endpoint (transport
   address) for Initiator and Responder.  Potential applicability to
   larger scopes needs to be examined.

4.  Advanced CoAP Congestion Control: RTO Estimation

   For an initiator that plans to make multiple requests to one
   destination endpoint, it may be worthwhile to make RTT measurements
   in order to obtain a better RTO estimation than that implied by the
   default initial timeout of 2 to 3 s.  This is based on the usual
   algorithms for RTO estimation [RFC6298], with appropriately extended
   default/base values, as proposed in Section 4.2.1.  Note that such a
   mechanism must, during idle periods, decay RTO estimates that are
   shorter or longer than the basic RTO estimate back to the basic RTO
   estimate, until fresh measurements become available again, as
   proposed in Section 4.3.

   One important consideration not relevant for TCP is the fact that a
   CoAP round-trip may include application processing time, which may be



Bormann, et al.          Expires April 29, 2018                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              CoAP Simple CoCoA               October 2017


   hard to predict, and may differ between different resources available
   at the same endpoint.  Also, for communications with networks of
   constrained devices that apply radio duty cycling, large and variable
   round-trip times are likely to be observed.  Servers will only
   trigger their early ACKs (with a non-piggybacked response to be sent
   later) based on the default timers, e.g. after 1 s.  A client that
   has arrived at a RTO estimate shorter than 1 s SHOULD therefore use a
   larger backoff factor for retransmissions to avoid expending all of
   its retransmissions in the default interval of 2 to 3 s.  A proposal
   for a mechanism with variable backoff factors is presented in
   Section 4.2.1.

   It may also be worthwhile to do RTT estimates not just based on
   information measured from a single destination endpoint, but also
   based on entire hosts (IP addresses) and/or complete prefixes (e.g.,
   maintain an RTT estimate for a whole /64).  The exact way this can be
   used to reduce the amount of state in an initiator is for further
   study.

4.1.  Blind RTO Estimate

   The initial RTO estimate for an endpoint is set to 2 seconds (the
   initial RTO estimate is used as the initial value for both E_weak_
   and E_strong_ below).

   If only the initial RTO estimate is available, the RTO estimate for
   each of up to NSTART exchanges started in parallel is set to 2 s
   times the number of parallel exchanges, e.g. if two exchanges are
   already running, the initial RTO estimate for an additional exchange
   is 6 seconds.

4.2.  Measured RTO Estimate

   The RTO estimator runs two copies of the algorithm defined in
   [RFC6298], as modified in Section 4.2.1: One copy for exchanges that
   complete on initial transmissions (the "strong estimator",
   E_strong_), and one copy for exchanges that have run into
   retransmissions, where only the first two retransmissions are
   considered (the "weak estimator", E_weak_).  For the latter, there is
   some ambiguity whether a response is based on the initial
   transmission or the retransmissions.  For the purposes of the weak
   estimator, the time from the initial transmission counts.  Responses
   obtained after the third retransmission are not used to update an
   estimator.

   The overall RTO estimate is an exponentially weighted moving average
   (alpha = 0.5 and 0.25, respectively) computed of the strong and the
   weak estimator, which is evolved after each contribution to the weak



Bormann, et al.          Expires April 29, 2018                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              CoAP Simple CoCoA               October 2017


   estimator (1) or to the strong estimator (2), from the estimator that
   made the most recent contribution:

      RTO := 0.25 * E_weak_ + 0.75 * RTO (1)

      RTO := 0.5 * E_strong_ + 0.5 * RTO (2)

   (Splitting this update into the two cases avoids making the
   contribution of the weak estimator too big in naturally lossy
   networks.)

4.2.1.  Modifications to the algorithm of RFC 6298

   This subsection presents three modifications that must be applied to
   the algorithm of [RFC6298] as per this document.  The first two
   recommend new parameter settings.  The third one is the variable
   backoff factor mechanism.

   The initial value for each of the two RTO estimators is 2 s.

   For the weak estimator, the factor K (the RTT variance multiplier) is
   set to 1 instead of 4.  This is necessary to avoid a strong increase
   of the RTO in the case that the RTTVAR value is very large, which may
   be the case if a weak RTT measurement is obtained after one or more
   retransmissions.

   If an RTO estimation is lower than 1 s or higher than 3 s, instead of
   applying a binary backoff factor in both cases, a variable backoff
   factor is used.  For RTO estimations below 1 s, the RTO for a
   retransmission is multiplied by 3, while for estimations above 3 s,
   the RTO is multiplied only by 1.5 (this updated choice of numbers to
   be verified by more simulations).  This helps to avoid that exchanges
   with small initial RTOs use up all retransmissions in a short
   interval of time and exchanges with large initial RTOs may not be
   able to carry out all retransmissions within MAX_TRANSMIT_WAIT
   (93 s).

   The binary exponential backoff is truncated at 32 seconds.  Similar
   to the way retransmissions are handled in the base specification,
   they are dithered between 1 x RTO and ACK_RANDOM_FACTOR x RTO.

4.2.2.  Discussion

   In contrast to [RFC6298], this algorithm attempts to make use of
   ambiguous information from retransmissions.  This is motivated by the
   high non-congestion loss rates expected in constrained node networks,
   and the need to update the RTO estimators even in the presence of
   loss.  This approach appears to contravene the mandate in



Bormann, et al.          Expires April 29, 2018                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              CoAP Simple CoCoA               October 2017


   Section 3.1.1 of [RFC8085] that "latency samples MUST NOT be derived
   from ambiguous transactions".  However, those samples are not simply
   combined into the strong estimator, but are used to correct the
   limited knowledge that can be gained from the strong RTT measurements
   by employing an additional weak estimator.  Evidence that has been
   collected from experiments appears to support that the overall effect
   of using this data in the way described is beneficial (Appendix A).

   Some evaluation has been done on earlier versions of this
   specification [Betzler2013].  A more recent (and more comprehensive)
   reference is [Betzler2015].

4.3.  Lifetime, Aging

   The state of the RTO estimators for an endpoint SHOULD be kept as
   long as possible.  If other state is kept for the endpoint (such as a
   DTLS connection), it is very strongly RECOMMENDED to keep the RTO
   state alive at least as long as this other state.  It MUST be kept
   for at least 255 s.

   If an estimator has a value that is lower than 1 s, and it is left
   without further update for 16 times its current value, the RTO
   estimate is doubled.  If an estimator has a value that is higher than
   3 s, and it is left without further update for 4 times its current
   value, the RTO estimate is set to be

      RTO := 1 s + (0.5 * RTO)

   (Note that, instead of running a timer, it is possible to implement
   these RTO aging calculations cumulatively at the time the estimator
   is used next.)

5.  Advanced CoAP Congestion Control: Non-Confirmables

   A CoAP endpoint MUST NOT send non-confirmables to another CoAP
   endpoint at a rate higher than defined by this document.  Independent
   of any congestion control mechanisms, a CoAP endpoint can always send
   non-confirmables if their rate does not exceed 1 B/s.

   Non-confirmables that form part of exchanges are governed by the
   rules for exchanges.

   Non-confirmables outside exchanges (e.g., [RFC7641] notifications
   sent as non-confirmables) are governed by the following rules:

   1.  Of any 16 consecutive messages towards this endpoint that aren't
       responses or acknowledgments, at least 2 of the messages must be
       confirmable.



Bormann, et al.          Expires April 29, 2018                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              CoAP Simple CoCoA               October 2017


   2.  The confirmable messages must be sent under an RTO estimator, as
       specified in Section 4.

   3.  The packet rate of non-confirmable messages cannot exceed 1/RTO,
       where RTO is the overall RTO estimator value at the time the non-
       confirmable packet is sent.

5.1.  Discussion

   This is relatively conservative.  More advanced versions of this
   algorithm could run a TFRC-style Loss Event Rate calculator [RFC5348]
   and apply the TCP equation to achieve a higher rate than 1/RTO.

   [RFC7641], Section 4.5.1, specifies that the rate of NONs SHOULD NOT
   exceed 1/RTT on average, if the server can maintain an RTT estimate
   for a client.  CoCoA limits the packet rate of NONs in this situation
   to 1/RTO.  Assuming that the RTO estimation in CoCoA works as
   expected, RTO[k] should be slightly greater than the RTT[k], thus
   CoCoA would be more conservative.  The expectation therefore is that
   complying with the NON rate set by CoCoA leads to complying with
   [RFC7641].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requirements on IANA.  (This section to be
   removed by RFC editor.)

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of, e.g., [RFC5681], [RFC2914], and
   [RFC8085] apply.  Some issues are already discussed in the security
   considerations of [RFC7252].

Appendix A.  Supporting evidence

   (Editor's note: The references local to this appendix may need to be
   merged with those from the specification proper, depending on the
   discretion of the RFC editor.)

   CoCoA has been evaluated by means of simulation and experimentation
   in diverse scenarios comprising different link layer technologies,
   network topologies, traffic patterns and device classes.  The main
   overall evaluation result is that CoCoA consistently delivers a
   performance which is better than, or at least similar to, that of
   default CoAP congestion control.  While the latter is insensitive to
   network conditions, CoCoA is adaptive and makes good use of RTT
   samples.

   It has been shown over real GPRS and IEEE 802.15.4 mesh network
   testebds that in these settings, in comparison to default CoAP, CoCoA
   increases throughput and reduces the time it takes for a network to
   process traffic bursts, while not sacrificing fairness.  In contrast,
   other RTT-sensitive approaches such as Linux-RTO or Peak-Hopper-RTO
   may be too simple or do not adapt well to IoT scenarios,
   underperforming default CoAP under certain conditions [1].  On the
   other hand, CoCoA has been found to reduce latency in GPRS and Wi-Fi
   setups, compared with default CoAP [2].

   CoCoA performance has also been evaluated for non-confirmable traffic
   over emulated GPRS/UMTS links and over a real IEEE 802.15.4 mesh
   testbed.  Results show that since CoCoA is adaptive, it yields better
   packet delivery ratio than default CoAP (which does not apply
   congestion control to non-confirmable messages) or Observe (which
   introduces congestion control that is not adaptive to network
   conditions) [3, 4].

A.1.  Older versions of the draft and improvement

   CoCoA has evolved since its initial draft version.  Its core has
   remained mostly stable since draft-bormann-core-cocoa-02.  The
   evolution of CoCoA has been driven by research work.  This process,
   including evaluations of early versions of CoCoA, as well as
   improvement proposals that were finally incorporated in CoCoA, is
   reflected in published works [5-10].
